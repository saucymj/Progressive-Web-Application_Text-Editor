# Progressive-Web-Application(PWA): Text Editor

## Description

I created this project so that a user will be able to create code snippets online or without internet connection. They are able to download the site as an application to their desktop or laptop. It solves the problem of coders not being able to have a place to save code while they might be in areas that signals aren't strong enough to keep them connected to internet. I learned how to create manifest files properly and register service-workers.

## Installation

From the backend of my application I first had to install all dependencies using `npm i` or `npm install` in every directory: client, src, develop, and server. Users will be able to openly download this site to their local machines using the install button on the website.
